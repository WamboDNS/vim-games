# vim-games
I want to learn vim. As a beginner, getting into vim feels really challenging. Especially, because some concepts of vim, like motions, are mostly muscle memory. 

That's why I want to clone a few older, known games and learn vim in a fun way. Ideally, I want to clone games that are easy to understand and play, but also help me to learn the controls of vim.

## Games
- [x] Snake

## How to play

1. Clone the repository, e.g.:

```git clone https://github.com/WamboDNS/vim-games.git```

2. Create the virtual environment:
```
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Start the game:
```
cd vim-games
python3 snake
```
